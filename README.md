This application has been built for tracking player points in the card game [Hearts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts_(card_game)). 

Although traditionally played with 4 people, this application can be used to track as many or as few players as you wish. 

It's optimized for 5 players on an iPhone 6/7/8.
